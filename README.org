- 👋 Hi, I’m @CalvinRoth
I'm a current masters student at U of MN but I sure hope to be a PhD someday. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computational number theory, linear algebra, optimization problems, and quantum cs. Also I really like combinatorics and graph theory but I'm not pursuing those hard at the time. 
Although those are my main areas of interest I have a fondness for applications to model/solve interesting problems and computer proof assistants 
like agda and lean. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about nondifferentiable optimization and sparse matrix methods over finite field
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things that are cs honestly
- 📫 How to reach me: email is rothx195@umn.edu
